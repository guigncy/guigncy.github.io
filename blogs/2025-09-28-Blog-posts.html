                <p><strong>How I will do my blog posts:</strong></p>

                <p>Usually, I write them on obsidian and convert the .md file to html
                using a command line tool called pandoc. Pretty sure a lot of sites or
                tools can do the same, but most of them are just a GUI for pandoc anyway
                so I wanted to go to the font.</p>
                <p>Markdown files(the .md) are a far better way to express anything
                compared to plain text of course, but also a lot more flexible than
                office formats. That’s what allows me to simply convert the text on this
                file in a text with html tags that can give me the same results.</p>
                <p>And yeah, I could use some static site generator to do the same for
                me, but it would be against the simplicity I wanted for this site.
                There’s no need for that, in one command I can get the text and copy
                paste to my template in html and generate a new page. + I have more
                flexibility to any file I want.</p>
                <p>Next post I’ll talk about AI. But I can assure you that anything
                written here in this post, and anything besides one or two doubts was
                made using AI on this site. The English grammar errors and the
                simplicity of this site are more than enough to prove me right. Anyway,
                that’s it for today, just some shit done in 10 minutes to have a first
                blog post done. I’m still thinking if I keep the same font, if I do a
                new style for the blog, or even if I get rid of this to be honest. No
                one will read it anyway, but let’s keep this for a while.</p>
