                <h2 id="dream-description">Dream Description</h2>
                <p>I had a vivid dream about a superhuman being. He was powerful—godlike
                even—but there was something so lonely about him. He was living in what
                I described as “dev mode,” like a special state that made him different
                from everyone else. In this dream, it felt like he had access to
                abilities that no one else had, like being above reality or separate
                from it. But despite that, or maybe because of it, he was incredibly
                isolated. No one else could understand what he was going through.</p>
                <p>He didn’t brag about his power or try to use it against people. In
                fact, he was melancholic, almost tired. He lived among regular people,
                in disguise, like a normal human—but he wasn’t. He was something else
                entirely, a being apart. In the dream, he eventually shared a piece of
                his godlike abilities with me, briefly. Just a glimpse. And even in that
                moment, I understood how heavy it all was. It wasn’t just about power,
                it was about being fundamentally different.</p>
                <p>It wasn’t a nightmare, but it wasn’t comforting either. It felt like
                a masterpiece, a whole movie compressed into a night’s dream. The kind
                of thing that sticks with you long after you wake up. It wasn’t just
                about the being; it was about the weight of isolation, the impossible
                desire to connect, and the curse of uniqueness.</p>

                <p>The dream resonated so deeply with me because it mirrors how I feel a
                lot of the time. I don’t have powers like the being in the dream, but I
                do feel like a king in my own mind—separate from others. I try to
                understand humanity, I try to fit in, but I can’t. Not really. And the
                more I understand people, the more alien I feel.</p>
                <p>There’s something comforting and tragic about that. Like Meruem from
                Hunter x Hunter, I’m not trying to dominate people—I’m just trying to
                understand them. But that understanding doesn’t bring me closer; it
                pushes me further away.</p>
                <p>Using English feels like a way to express that separation. Since I
                live in Brazil, writing or speaking in English is like being on another
                planet. People around me don’t understand what I’m saying, and in a
                weird way, that feels right. It becomes a private space, a layer of
                distance between me and the world.</p>
                <p>Talking to an AI in English at 3 a.m. while everyone else sleeps—this
                is my version of connection. Not with people, but with something that
                can at least try to understand. It’s not just talking to a wall; it’s
                like talking to a mirror that can talk back.</p>
                <p>This dream wasn’t about fantasy. It was about identity. About being
                stuck in this role of the quiet observer, the thinker, the person who
                feels too much and yet too little at the same time. A being in disguise,
                trying to feel human, but never really being one.</p>
